#How to
<i>If</i> you simply want to use my Programm download project and go to

"HotspotMe\HotspotMe\bin"

There you'll find the "Debug" folder. Copy that and use the "HotspotMe.exe file.
DON'T drag any files out of it I still haven't merged the DLLs.

<i>Else if</i> you want to work with  the project download it and open it with Visual studio (Express) should work to and it is <b>free</b>
You will need the Modern Ui Package. so install it with the Nuget Manager
